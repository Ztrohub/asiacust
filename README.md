## üßê About The Project

This project started as a late-night, caffeine-fueled fever dream to solve a problem that probably didn't exist. Now, it's a slightly more structured, caffeine-fueled fever dream that solves that non-existent problem with surprising effectiveness.

It's designed to manage employee and daily job for service provider, but its true purpose is to look impressive on my GitHub profile.

## üêõ Known Issues (a.k.a. "Features")

*   The UI occasionally renders in ancient hieroglyphics.   We're calling it a "localization feature."
*   Sometimes, instead of doing its job, the program just prints pictures of cats. It's a feature, not a bug.
*   Performance degrades when you look at it funny.
